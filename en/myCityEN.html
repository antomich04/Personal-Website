            <h2>Katerini</h2>
            <p>Katerini is a city in Macedonia, which serves as the seat of the Municipality of Katerini and the capital 
                of the Regional Unit of Pieria in the Central Macedonia Region. According to the 2021 Census, it has a 
                population of 59,189 residents. It is situated on a hill, between the Pierian Mountains and the Thermaic Gulf, 
                at an altitude of 14 m to 45 m and at a distance of 71 km from Thessaloniki.</p> <br>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The residents participated in all the national liberation struggles of the Greeks, from the Revolution of 1821, 
                the movement of 1854, the Macedonian Revolution of 1878, to the Macedonian Struggle. Significant Macedonian fighters 
                were the military leaders of the region, Nikolaos Strebinas and Nikolaos Babakas, as well as Alkiviadis Papadimitriou.</p>
            <p>The liberation of the city from the Ottoman Empire finally took place on October 16, 1912. After its liberation in 1912, Katerini 
                became a municipality until June 28, 1918. From 1920 to 1930, Katerini functioned as a community. The first Municipal Council took 
                place on September 4, 1929. In 1931, the Municipal Market of Katerini was constructed.</p>
            <p>During the years 1913-1914, families of Thracian refugees from Eastern Thrace and Eastern Romylia, totaling 5,000 individuals, settled 
                in the area. Many of them originated from Arteska in Eastern Thrace. This was followed by the Asia Minor Catastrophe and the settlement 
                of Asia Minor Greeks in the region. With the arrival of these refugees, the population of the city more than doubled.</p>
            <p>During the Second World War, Katerini was occupied by the German army on April 14, 1941, and was liberated three years later. In 1944, the 
                General Hospital of the city was established.</p>
            <p>The residents of Katerini have been involved in tourism businesses, road transportation, livestock farming, and agriculture, including the 
                cultivation of tobacco and kiwi. Kiwi cultivation experienced significant growth in Katerini and Pieria, being the first place in Greece 
                where it was cultivated, thanks to the initiative of Tasos Michos, who served as an agricultural supervisor in the Directorate of Agriculture 
                in Pieria.</p>
            <p>Today, Katerini is a tourist destination with the development of organized resorts on the coasts of Kallithea, Korinos, Olympiaki Akti, Paralia,
                 and Peristasi. The city also boasts one of the largest urban parks in Greece, featuring artificial lakes, fountains, and sculptures. In 2008, 
                 the city's railway station was reconstructed in the eponymous neighborhood, and since 2007, it has been connected by suburban railway to the 
                 city of Thessaloniki, known as the Thessaloniki Suburban Railway. Every September, the trade fair (Emporopanigyri) is held in the settlement 
                 of Andromachi.</p> <br>

            <h2>Name</h2>
            <p>It is unknown since when it existed as a town. The name of the city seems to have its roots in Saint Catherine of Alexandria, a Christian martyr 
                who lived in the 4th century. According to another view, the designation comes from the ancient Macedonian city of Atera.</p>
            <p>Many travelers, such as William Martin Leake, as well as maps from as early as the 13th century (1264), mention the city by the name Athera 
                (station or settlement Hatera), and several saw an influence on the name of the city (Katerini – Katera- Hatira- Athera). François Pouqueville 
                reached the same conclusion, noting the place as Kateri Hatera on a map. Leon Eze calculated the location of ancient Athera near Kontariotissa, 
                while Kurz places the settlement somewhere between the present-day villages of Korinos and Kallithea.</p>
            <p>Another hypothesis refers to the chapel of Saint Catherine, located to the east of the city, where the old cemetery is now situated. The icons 
                in the temple date back to 1831, and it is possible that there was a previous temple in the same location.</p>
            <p>The city appears with the official name Katerini or Saint Catherine in bureaucratic language, and this was the case until the early 20th century. 
                Eventually, the name Katerini prevailed, and November 25th is considered a local holiday in honor of the patron Saint Catherine.</p> <br>
