            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my little corner on the Internet. My name is Antonis Michailos and I am 19 years old. I was born on July 12, 2004, in Katerini, and grew up in a 
                village just outside the city, Peristasi. I would say that I am "blessed" to have grown up in the countryside, as children there have nature at their doorstep to 
                go out and explore, unlike kids growing up in a metropolis like Thessaloniki. Additionally, there is a greater sense of safety in the countryside since the 
                population is significantly smaller, and the residents of a village know each other rather than just being neighbors. Currently, I am studying at the International
                 Hellenic University (IHU), in the Department of Information and Electronics Engineering , and I am in my second year of studies.I am deeply passionate about the
                  dynamic and ever-evolving field of computer science, with a special emphasis on front-end web development, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and graphic
                   design. As a front-end developer, I enjoy the challenge of creating interfaces that are not only aesthetically appealing but also user-friendly, seamlessly 
                   integrating form and function. The intersection of machine learning and artificial intelligence captivates me, as I am interested in the potential to create 
                   intelligent systems that can learn and adapt. Exploring algorithms, data structures, and the latest developments in these fields is a continuous source of 
                   exciting moments for me.Furthermore, my interest extends to graphic design, where I find joy in translating creative ideas into visually stunning digital 
                   experiences. Through these scattered efforts in computer science, driven by my desire to contribute to technological innovation, I aspire to create significant 
                   and impactful solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the world of computer science, I also have a strong interest in other areas related to technology. Game development is an exciting adventure for 
                me, where I can combine my creativity with technical expertise. I emphasize the importance of sound and video processing in the digital world and engage in creating 
                high-quality audio and visual elements. Furthermore, the evolution of virtual reality fascinates me as I explore the realm of iconic experiences it can offer. 
                These intriguing aspects of technology serve as a source of inspiration and exploration for me as I work towards creating exciting and innovative experiences for 
                the technological world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from the field of computer science and technology, I find joy and satisfaction in various interests and hobbies. Video games serve as both entertainment and 
                a narrative escape, offering a variety of virtual worlds and challenges. If I had to choose my top 3 favorite video games, they would be God of War III, Red Dead 
                Redemption 2, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. In the realm of music, I find tranquility and inspiration, exploring various genres and artists. My favorite music 
                genre is folk songs. The artists I frequently listen to include Antonis Remos, Nikos Oikonomopoulos, George Sabanis, and the "lord" Vasilis Karras. Football is not 
                just a physical activity for me but a passion that brings a sense of social and collective connection. Whether it's the strategic moves in the virtual battlefield, 
                the rhythmic harmony of music, or the expressive moments on the football field, these pursuits provide balance to my technological endeavors. Engaging in these 
                hobbies helps me relax, shaping a multi-dimensional perspective and enriching my life beyond the screen and code.
