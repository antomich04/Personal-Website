            <h2>International Hellenic University</h2>
            <p>The International Hellenic University (IHU) was established in Thessaloniki in 2005 by law 3391 
                and began its operation in 2008. The faculties are located in Thessaloniki (in the University Campus in 
                Sindos, Alexandria, and at the 14th km of Thessaloniki - N. Moudania in Thermi), in Kavala, Drama, and 
                Serres. Branches also exist in Katerini, Kilkis, and Didymoteicho.</p>
            <p>The International Hellenic University is funded by the European Union and the Greek Government. 
                Its mission and goal are to provide higher education to both Greeks and foreigners and to generate and 
                disseminate innovative knowledge in the scientific fields it engages with. It specializes in offering postgraduate 
                programs targeting international students interested in studying in Greece and Greek students seeking international perspectives.</p>
            <p>As a public university, all degrees awarded are recognized by the state, the European Union, and internationally. It already attracts 
                teaching and research staff from the international academic community and students from various countries, such as Azerbaijan, Albania, 
                Armenia, Belgium, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, the United States, Cameroon, Lithuania, Mexico, Moldova, Ukraine, Romania, 
                Russia, Slovakia, Sudan, and Turkey. In 2015, it had 408 students, of whom 11% were international.</p>
            <p>In 2019, the university absorbed the Technological Educational Institutes (T.E.I.) of Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia, and Eastern Macedonia 
                and Thrace, which were abolished. Until then, DI.PAE. was the only public university in the country where programs were exclusively taught 
                in the English language.</p> <br>
