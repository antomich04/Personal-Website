            <h2>Historical retrospective</h2>
            <img src="../Images/AEP/AEPLogo.png" id="teamLogo">
            <p>
                Since I can remember myself, I have maintained a strong passion for football. I started my involvement at the age of 10 in 2014 with my 
                local village team, Athlitiki Enosi Peristasis (AEP), and since then, I have been a loyal "servant" of this team. Peristasi is a historic 
                team in the Pieria region and has been competing in the A' category of the local league for a decade or more, since 2012. In fact, during the 
                2013-2014 season, Peristasi won the A' category championship and advanced to the promotion playoffs for the C National category. However, they 
                did not manage to finish in a favorable position, so the next season found them back in the A' category of Pieria. The grand final of the championship 
                took place at the A' DAK of Katerini, the home ground of Pierikos, a match in which I was present as a spectator and supporter of AEP. That match was 
                the occasion for me to start playing football for Peristasi.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the 2014-2015 season, I have been playing for Peristasi, starting from the team's academies and reaching the first team in the 2018-2019 season. 
                The truth is, when I first started, I didn't know what position I wanted to play. Undoubtedly, every little child dreams of becoming a renowned striker 
                who scores in every match. However, my case was different. I always admired defenders and especially goalkeepers, considering it more impressive to prevent 
                a goal than to score one yourself. My idol is Gianluigi Buffon, the best goalkeeper in the history of the sport in my opinion. The years I spent in the 
                academies were some of the best years of my life, as I made countless acquaintances and many close friendships that last to this day, while also playing the 
                sport I loved. When the time came to join the first team at the age of just 14, I was very excited. I will never forget the moments and emotions I experienced 
                that season, starting from the first team meeting in July 2018, the first training in early August, to the last training session in June 2019. During that season, 
                I recorded only one appearance, my debut in a match that will remain indelible in my memory. After all, every athlete will forever remember their debut.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following season (2019-2020) was the first time I got a significant opportunity on the field. Midway through the season, our team's starting goalkeeper suffered 
                a serious shoulder injury, making me the only available goalkeeper on the team roster. During the period when our main goalkeeper was injured, approximately for 2 
                months, I had 7 appearances in both league and cup matches. Unfortunately, I was unlucky as the season ended abruptly and prematurely in March 2020 due to the 
                escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only season in which I played for a team other than Peristasi was the 2020-2021 season when I went on a "promising" transfer (loan) to Katerini FC, a 
                newly established team participating for the first time in its history in the leagues of Pieria. I don't have many memories from this season as it coincided 
                with the onset of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns. I recorded only one appearance in the third division with Katerini FC.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following season (2021-2022) marked the only dark spot in the recent history of Peristasi as we were relegated to the B category of Pieria, finishing 
                last in the standings. The consequences of the pandemic were devastating for AEP, leaving it financially drained, as was the case for many other sports clubs. 
                It was undoubtedly the most peculiar season I have experienced as an athlete, and I do not believe there will be a similar one in the future. In this dark chapter 
                of the team, I had 14 appearances, some of which were in positions other than that of the goalkeeper!
            </p>
            <p>
                Τhe two upcoming seasons (2022-2023, 2023-) could be characterized as transitional for me. In August 2022, I learned that I had been accepted to International 
                Hellenic University (IHU), and I had to part ways with the team after almost a decade. In the first season, I had only one appearance in a cup match, while this
                 season, I have integrated into Peristasis' B team—a commendable effort by the team to field a squad composed of young players to gain experience in the C category 
                 of Pieria. This provided a good opportunity for me to stay close to sports and Peristasi, as I couldn't meet the demands of the first team while also pursuing my 
                 studies. Now, I come to the term "transitional." I chose it because I am currently in the process of finding a team here in Thessaloniki where I am studying. I want 
                 to join a team here because, as an athlete, I have the expectation of being committed to training, something challenging to achieve in Peristasi.

                <h3>Neos Pamvriakos - A.E.Peristasis 1-9</h3>
                <p>The day it all began. On March 31, 2019, I made my official debut with Peristasi in an away game against Neos Pamvriakos. Specifically, I entered the field as 
                    a substitute in the 50th minute when the score was 0-5. As evident from the final score, the match wasn't subject to much scrutiny, given the vast difference 
                    in strength between the two teams. Beyond my debut, it's worth noting that this particular match has left its mark in the history of the Pieria Football 
                    Association (ΕΠΣ Πιερίας). Peristasi set a record that day, specifically related to me. I became the youngest goalkeeper to play in an official match in 
                    the A' category of ΕΠΣ Πιερίας. An entire article has been written about this match, which you can read
                    <a href="https://pieriasportsite.blogspot.com/2019/04/14.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <h3>A.E.Peristasis - Pierikos Astir Kato Agianni 1-2</h3>
                <p>
                    The next milestone match was on November 30, 2019, against Pierikos Astir Kato Agianni at home. It was a crucial match in terms of points, as both 
                    teams were close in the standings. Unfortunately, we couldn't secure a win, and as a result, the team from Kato Agiani overtook us in the standings 
                    in the battle for survival. You can watch the highlights of this particular match <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSUsnxgFpYI" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                    The reason this match is a milestone is that it was my first official appearance in a home game for AEP.

                <h3>Dias Diou - A.E.Peristasis 7-1</h3>
                <p>
                    Ιf I could characterize this match, I would give it the title "madness." On April 3, 2022, we faced Dias Diou away for the 22nd and final matchday of the 
                    "cursed" season 2021-2022, where we were relegated. The match obviously doesn't withstand criticism since, being at the bottom of the league, there were 
                    limited options against the team that finished in 3rd place that season. This match will stay unforgettable for me as it was one of the two matches that 
                    season where I had to play in a different position. In this particular one, I played as a defensive midfielder wearing the number 8. In the team photo, 
                    I am the second standing on the left.
                </p>

                <h3> A.E.Peristasis - Aiginiakos 5-0</h3>
                <p>
                    The last milestone in my career to date would be the last official match I played with Peristasi. On September 11, 2022, we faced the formidable Aiginiakos 
                    at home for the first phase of the EPS Pierias Cup. In this match, Aiginiakos was the clear favorite, as the two teams were one division apart, with us 
                    playing in the B Division. However, we proved ourselves worthy and with a stunning performance, we dominated one of the top teams in the Pieria region with
                     an impressive score of 5-0. It is perhaps the best way I could have closed this wonderful chapter with my heart's team, Athlitiki Enosi Peristasis.
